# Metroscope Modeling Library

## Content

 The Metroscope Modeling Library contains modelica modules for industrial components such as pumps, turbines, heat exchangers, to build steady-state digital twins of industrial process. The associated documentation contains explanation of the library equations. 

## Usage

- When creating a Digital Twin you should only use official releases of `Metroscope Modeling Library`. Official releases can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Metroscope-dev/metroscope-modeling-library/releases).
- In your model, you should add a line in `annotation`, containing the following : `uses(MetroscopeModelingLibrary(version(="3.0.1"))` in which you replace the version number (`"3.0.1"`) by the one you use. That way you will get a warning if you use your model with a wrong version of the library.
- If you need additionnal features, please ask for them using [issues](https://github.com/Metroscope-dev/metroscope-modeling-library/issues)

## Documentation

Library documentation is available in this [public Notion space](https://metroscope.notion.site/Metroscope-Modeling-Library-Documentation-50c8703c294446059d3b4a70d6ae4a71?pvs=4). 
You can use comments in the documentation to ask questions about the library. Please do not include any proprieraty information. In order to comment the page, you need to create a Notion account.
